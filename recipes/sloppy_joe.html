            <h2>Sloppy Joe</h2>
            <p>
                Sloppy Joes can be amazing, didn’t you know? It doesn’t have to be a quick, thrown together meal from a can that kids can tolerate.
                It can be flavorful and packed full of delicious vegetables. It can have texture!
                PRO TIP: Toast your buns before placing your meat on. This will take your sloppy Joes to the next level!
                Simply place open-face on a baking sheet and put under the broiler setting on your oven.
                Broil for 1 to 2 minutes until lightly browned, but keep an eye on them so they don’t burn.

            <h2>Notes</h2>
            <p>
                You can adjust the amount of vegetables to your own personal taste. However, the vegetables add extra flavor and amazing texture to this historically mushy sandwich of our childhood,
                and we do recommend sticking to the recipe as closely as possible.
